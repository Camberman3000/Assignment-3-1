Once upon a time, there were two cats who lived in a small rural town. They were very good friends and always played together.
One day, they met a turtle who was looking for some friends. The cats were very happy to meet the turtle and they all became good friends. They played together 
every day and had a lot of fun. The cats and the turtle lived happily ever after.
